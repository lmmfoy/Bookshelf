## Using Bookshelf

### Logging In
Users must first create an account for themselves. Bookshelf uses Auth0 for authentication, ensuring that login data remains secure and allowing users to log in using their Google accounts if they choose. 

Once logged in, users will be brought to their dashboard. From here, they can access their bookshelves or search for new books.

The books on the shelves will initially show simply the book cover and title, but will flip to show further information when hovered over.

Users can add new bookshelves on their dashboard by clicking the "Add shelf" tag. This will open a modal allowing them to add shelf name and description.
